                    Basically, this analysis is an extension of the two-intervals analysis, which allows the side by side comparison of multiple targets and backgrounds. <br>\n                      The span of the time intervals, used to “segment” the initial time window can be set by the user by means of a dedicated drop-down menu.\n                      Genome sequences are assigned to an

performed pairwise, by considering consecutive intervals: for every pair the most recent interval is used as the target and the preceding interval is used as background. <br>\n                      The final output provides a detailed report of the prevalence of amino-acid substitutions at different points in time.\n                      An intuitive heatmap representation (intervals on the column, amino-acid changes on the rows) is used to display the prevalence of each substitution in time.\n                      Comparisons of consecutive intervals can provide useful information on relative prevalence trends and/or patterns of fixation of specific amino acid changes.\n                      <br><br>\n                      <p align=\"center\">\n                        <v-img\n

      Users can also apply all the advanced filters (protein/gene, prevalence, odds ratio, p-value, under/over representation) described in the previous section to limit the scope of the analysis.\n
